## Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity:**

- **Definition:** Describes how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the input size.
- **How to Explain:**
    - Break down the algorithm into its loops and recursive calls.
    - Use concrete examples (e.g., in the sliding window, each character is processed at most twice).
    - Emphasize worst-case scenarios to highlight upper bounds (e.g., "in the worst case, every character is revisited, leading to O(n) time").

**Space Complexity:**

- **Definition:** Refers to the additional memory required by the algorithm (excluding the input).
- **How to Explain:**
    - Identify data structures used (arrays, sets, DP tables).
    - Discuss whether these structures scale with the input size or remain fixed (e.g., fixed-size frequency arrays yield O(1) space).
    - Use visual aids like memory diagrams to show how the space grows with input size.

## Common String Problems

### 1. Palindrome Check

**Problem:** *Valid Palindrome*

**Description:** Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome by considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

**Example:**

- **Input:** `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Approach:**
    
    Use two pointers—one starting at the beginning and one at the end—skipping non-alphanumeric characters and comparing in a case-insensitive manner.

### 2. Anagram Detection

**Problem:** *Valid Anagram*

**Description:** Given two strings, determine if one string is an anagram of the other (i.e., both strings contain **the same characters with the same frequency**).

**Example:**

- **Input:** `s = "anagram"`, `t = "nagaram"`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Approach:**
    
    Count the frequency of each character (or sort both strings) and compare the results.

### 3. Substring Search

**Problem:** *Implement strStr()*

**Description:** Given two strings (a haystack and a needle), return the index of the first occurrence of the needle in the haystack, or `-1` if the needle is not present.

**Example:**

- **Input:** `haystack = "hello"`, `needle = "ll"`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Approach:**
    
    A simple method is to **slide a window** over the haystack and compare the substring with the needle. More advanced approaches include the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for better efficiency.

### 4. String Reversal

**Problem:** *Reverse String*

**Description:** Reverse the characters of a given string in place.

**Example:**

- **Input:** `"hello"`
- **Output:** `"olleh"`
- **Approach:**
    
    Use a **two-pointer technique**: swap characters from the beginning and end of the string until the pointers meet.

## Related Algorithm & Technique

### 1. **Two-Pointer Technique**

**Example:** *Palindrome Check*

- **Problem Recap:** Check if a string (ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case) is a palindrome.
- **Technique:**
    - Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning and one at the end.
    - Move both pointers toward the center while comparing characters.
- **Time Complexity:**
    - Since each character is compared once, the algorithm runs in **O(n)** time (n is the string length).
- **Space Complexity:**
    - Only a few variables (pointers) are used, resulting in **O(1)** (constant) space.

### 2. **Sliding Window Technique**

**Example:** *Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters*

- **Problem Recap:** Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without any repeating characters.
- **Technique Overview:**
    - Use a "window" (defined by two indices) to scan through the string.
    - Expand the window until a duplicate is encountered; then, contract it until the duplicate is removed.
- **Pseudocode:**
    
    ```
    function longestUniqueSubstr(s):
        create empty set window
        left = 0, maxLength = 0
        for right from 0 to len(s)-1:
             while s[right] in window:
                 remove s[left] from window
                 left++
             add s[right] to window
             maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)
        return maxLength
    
    ```
    
- **Time Complexity Explanation:**
    - Even though there’s a nested loop, each character is processed at most twice (once when added and once when removed). This leads to an overall **O(n)** time complexity.
- **Space Complexity Explanation:**
    - The extra space is used by the set (or hash map) that stores the current window of characters. If the character set is fixed (like 26 lowercase letters), the space is **O(1)**. Otherwise, in the worst case it can be **O(n)**.

### 3. **Hashing / Frequency Counting**

**Example:** *Anagram Detection*

- **Problem Recap:** Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- **Technique Overview:**
    - Count the frequency of each character in both strings using a fixed-size array or hash map.
    - Compare the two frequency distributions.
- **Time Complexity:**
    - Counting frequencies requires one pass through each string, so the complexity is **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**
    - Using an array with a fixed size (for instance, 26 for lowercase letters) yields **O(1)** space complexity.

### 4. **Dynamic Programming**

**Example:** *Longest Common Substring*

- **Problem Recap:** Find the longest substring common to two given strings.
- **Technique Overview:**
    - Create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common suffix ending at positions `i` and `j` in the two strings.
    - Update the table based on previous computations.
- **Time Complexity:**
    - Filling the table takes **O(m*n)** time (where m and n are the lengths of the two strings).
- **Space Complexity:**
    - The DP table uses **O(m*n)** space. (Optimizations can reduce this to **O(min(m, n))** by only keeping two rows.)
